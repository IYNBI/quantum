# Finite Square Well - Quantum Mechanics
Finite Square Well
This repository contains Python code that explores the bound and scattering states in a finite square well, as inspired by David Griffiths' "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics." ðŸŽ“ðŸ”¬

# Overview
The finite square well model is a classic example in quantum mechanics that demonstrates confinement and tunneling effects. It involves studying the behavior of particles within a potential well that has a finite width.

# Features
Calculation of bound state energies: The code provides functions to compute the quantized energy levels for bound states within the finite square well.

Calculation of scattering state energies: The code includes functions to determine the energy of scattering states, where particles can escape from the well.
